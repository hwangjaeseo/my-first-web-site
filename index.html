<h2>Web이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web, often abbreviated as WWW or referred to simply as the web, is an information system in which documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). These URLs may be interlinked by hypertext links and are accessible over the internet. Users access the web through web browsers, and they transmit data using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or its secure variant, HTTPS.</p>
